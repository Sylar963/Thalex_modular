# Thalex Python Client

This is a Python client library for interacting with the [Thalex](https://www.thalex.com) derivatives exchange API.

It is provided free of charge, as is, with no warranties and no recommendations â€“ see MIT license.

## Usage

The client provides a function for every WebSocket endpoint with type hints and a receive function 
that returns messages from the exchange one by one.

```python
import thalex as th
from thalex import Network

# Initialize client
client = th.Thalex(network=Network.TEST)  # Use Network.PROD for production

# Connect to WebSocket
await client.connect()

# Get instruments
await client.instruments(id=1)
response = await client.receive()
```
