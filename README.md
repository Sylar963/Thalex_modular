# Thalex SimpleQuoter: Modular Avellaneda Market Maker

A high-performance, production-ready cryptocurrency market making bot implementing the Avellaneda-Stoikov strategy, now featuring a modular "Clean Architecture" design and optimized for the [Thalex](https://www.thalex.com) derivatives exchange.

## 🚀 Recent Updates & Current State

The project has transitioned to a modular **Ports and Adapters (Clean Architecture)** structure while maintaining the robust performance of the legacy system.

- **Modular Architecture**: New Core logic in `src/` for better testability and scalability.
- **Hedging Removed**: Hedging functionality has been completely removed to prioritize core quoting efficiency and reduce complexity.
- **Database Integration**: Added native support for **TimescaleDB** for high-performance trade and market data persistence.
- **Enhanced Signal Engine**: Refined Volume Adjusted Market Pressure (VAMP) calculations.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Thalex API Keys (Testnet recommended initially)
- (Optional) TimescaleDB/PostgreSQL instance

### Installation

1. **Clone & Setup Environment**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Thalex_modular
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .example.env .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` and fill in your Thalex API keys and database credentials.

3. **Start the Database (Required for API & Storage)**:
   The project uses TimescaleDB for data persistence. Start it using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   *Note: This will start TimescaleDB on port 5433 (mapping 5432 internal).*

### Running the System

To have a fully functional frontend experience, you need both the Trading Bot and the Backend API running.

#### 1. Start the Trading Bot
The bot fetches market data, executes strategy logic, and persists data to the database.
```bash
# Recommended: Modular Architecture
python src/main.py
```

#### 2. Start the Backend API (For Frontend)
The API serves simulation and live data to the Svelte dashboard.
```bash
# The API runs on http://localhost:8000
python -m uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
```

#### 3. Frontend Development
Ensure your `vite.config.ts` in the frontend project is routing `/api` traffic to `localhost:8000`.

## 🏗️ Architecture Deep Dive

### Modular System (`src/`)
Our new architecture separates business logic from infrastructure:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains the "brain" of the bot.
  - `AvellanedaStoikovStrategy`: The core mathematical pricing model.
  - `VolumeCandleSignalEngine`: Generates VAMP signals from volume flow.
  - `BasicRiskManager`: Enforces safety limits.
- **Adapters Layer**: Handles communication with the outside world.
  - `ThalexAdapter`: WebSocket/REST integration with Thalex.
  - `TimescaleDBAdapter`: High-throughput time-series storage.
- **Use Case Layer**:
  - `QuotingService`: Orchestrates data flow between the exchange and strategy.

### Legacy Core (`thalex_py/`)
The legacy system remains available for established workflows, featuring:
- **Object Pooling**: Extremely low latency by reusing message structures.
- **Shared Memory**: Optimized data access for high-frequency updates.
- **Direct Event Bus**: Low-overhead internal communication.

## 📈 Technical Features

### Avellaneda-Stoikov Model
The bot calculates optimal bid/ask spreads based on:
- **Gamma (γ)**: Risk aversion parameter.
- **Kappa (κ)**: Market depth/liquidity factor.
- **Inventory Risk**: Dynamic skewing of quotes based on current position.

### VAMP (Volume Adjusted Market Pressure)
Integrated into the `VolumeCandleSignalEngine`, VAMP analyzes aggressive order flow to detect:
- Momentum and reversal likelihood.
- Potential exhaustion points.
- Volatility predictions for spread adjustment.

### Risk Management
- **Position Limits**: Max BTC exposure per instrument.
- **Drawdown Protection**: Automatic halting on significant losses.
- **Take Profit**: Built-in triggers for unrealized PnL.
